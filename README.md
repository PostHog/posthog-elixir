[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation-gray)](https://hexdocs.pm/posthog)

A powerful Elixir client for [PostHog](https://posthog.com), providing seamless integration with PostHog's analytics and feature flag APIs.

## Features

- Event Capture: Track user actions and custom events
- Feature Flags: Manage feature flags and multivariate tests
- Batch Processing: Send multiple events efficiently
- Custom Properties: Support for user, group, and person properties
- Flexible Configuration: Customizable JSON library and API version
- Environment Control: Disable tracking in development/test environments
- Configurable HTTP Client: Customizable timeouts, retries, and HTTP client implementation

## Installation

Add `posthog` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:posthog, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

You'll also need to include this library under your application tree. You can do so by including `:posthog` under your `:extra_applications` key inside `mix.exs`

```elixir
# mix.exs
def application do
  [
    extra_applications: [
      # ... your existing applications
      :posthog
    ]
  ]
```

### Application Customization

This library includes `Posthog.Application` because we bundle `Cachex` to avoid you from being charged too often for feature-flag checks against the same `{flag, distinct_id}` tuple.

This cache is located under `:posthog_feature_flag_cache`. If you want more control over the application, you can init it yourself in your own `application.ex`

```elixir
# lib/my_app/application.ex

defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      # Your other application children...
      {Posthog.Application, []}
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

## Configuration

Add your PostHog configuration to your application's config:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :posthog,
  api_url: "https://us.posthog.com",  # Or `https://eu.posthog.com` or your self-hosted PostHog instance URL
  api_key: "phc_your_project_api_key"

# Optional configurations
config :posthog,
  json_library: Jason,  # Default JSON parser (optional)
  enabled: true,       # Whether to enable PostHog tracking (optional, defaults to true)
  http_client: Posthog.HTTPClient.Hackney,  # Default HTTP client (optional)
  http_client_opts: [  # HTTP client options (optional)
    timeout: 5_000,    # Request timeout in milliseconds (default: 5_000)
    retries: 3,        # Number of retries on failure (default: 3)
    retry_delay: 1_000 # Delay between retries in milliseconds (default: 1_000)
  ]
```

### HTTP Client Configuration

The library uses Hackney as the default HTTP client, but you can configure its behavior or even swap it for a different implementation by simply implementing the `Posthog.HTTPClient` behavior:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :posthog,
  # Use a different HTTP client implementation
  http_client: MyCustomHTTPClient,

  # Configure HTTP client options
  http_client_opts: [
    timeout: 10_000,   # 10 seconds timeout
    retries: 5,        # 5 retries
    retry_delay: 2_000 # 2 seconds between retries
  ]
```

For testing, you might want to use a mock HTTP client:

```elixir
# test/support/mocks.ex
defmodule Posthog.HTTPClient.Test do
  @behaviour Posthog.HTTPClient

  def post(url, body, headers, _opts) do
    # Return mock responses for testing
    {:ok, %{status: 200, headers: [], body: %{}}}
  end
end

# config/test.exs
config :posthog,
  http_client: Posthog.HTTPClient.Test
```

### Disabling PostHog capture

You can disable PostHog tracking by setting `enabled_capture: false` in your configuration. This is particularly useful in development or test environments where you don't want to send actual events to PostHog.

When `enabled_capture` is set to `false`:

- All `Posthog.capture/3` and `Posthog.batch/3` calls will succeed silently
- PostHog will still communicate with the server for Feature Flags

This is useful for:

- Development and test environments where you don't want to pollute your PostHog instance
- Situations where you need to temporarily disable tracking

Example configuration for development:

```elixir
# config/dev.exs
config :posthog,
  enabled_capture: false  # Disable tracking in development
```

Example configuration for test:

```elixir
# config/test.exs
config :posthog,
  enabled_capture: false  # Disable tracking in test environment
```

## Usage

### Capturing Events

Simple event capture:

```elixir
# Basic event with `event` and `distinct_id`, both required
Posthog.capture("page_view", "user_123")

# Event with properties
Posthog.capture("purchase", "user_123", %{
    product_id: "prod_123",
    price: 99.99,
    currency: "USD"
})

# Event with custom timestamp
Posthog.capture("signup_completed", "user_123", %{}, timestamp: DateTime.utc_now())

# Event with custom UUID
uuid = "..."
Posthog.capture("signup_completed", "user_123", %{}, uuid: uuid)

# Event with custom headers
Posthog.capture(
  "login",
  "user_123",
  %{},
  headers: [{"x-forwarded-for", "127.0.0.1"}]
)
```

### Batch Processing

Send multiple events in a single request:

```elixir
events = [
  {"page_view", "user_123", %{}},
  {"button_click", "user_123", %{button_id: "signup"}}
]

Posthog.batch(events)
```

### Feature Flags

Get all feature flags for a user:

```elixir
{:ok, flags} = Posthog.feature_flags("user_123")

# Response format:
# %{
#   "featureFlags" => %{"flag-1" => true, "flag-2" => "variant-b"},
#   "featureFlagPayloads" => %{
#     "flag-1" => true,
#     "flag-2" => %{"color" => "blue", "size" => "large"}
#   }
# }
```

Check specific feature flag:

```elixir
# Boolean feature flag
{:ok, flag} = Posthog.feature_flag("new-dashboard", "user_123")
# Returns: %Posthog.FeatureFlag{name: "new-dashboard", payload: true, enabled: true}

# Multivariate feature flag
{:ok, flag} = Posthog.feature_flag("pricing-test", "user_123")
# Returns: %Posthog.FeatureFlag{
#   name: "pricing-test",
#   payload: %{"price" => 99, "period" => "monthly"},
#   enabled: "variant-a"
# }

# Quick boolean check
if Posthog.feature_flag_enabled?("new-dashboard", "user_123") do
  # Show new dashboard
end
```

Feature flags with group properties:

```elixir
Posthog.feature_flags("user_123",
  groups: %{company: "company_123"},
  group_properties: %{company: %{industry: "tech"}},
  person_properties: %{email: "user@example.com"}
)
```

#### Stop sending `$feature_flag_called`

We automatically send `$feature_flag_called` events so that you can properly keep track of which feature flags you're accessing via `Posthog.feature_flag()` calls. If you wanna save some events, you can disable this by adding `send_feature_flag_event: false` to the call:

```elixir
# Boolean feature flag
{:ok, flag} = Posthog.feature_flag("new-dashboard", "user_123", send_feature_flag_event: false)
```

## Local Development

Run `bin/setup` to install development dependencies or run the following commands manually:

We recommend using `asdf` to manage Elixir and Erlang versions:

```sh
# Install required versions
asdf install

# Install dependencies
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

Run tests:

```sh
bin/test
```

(This runs `mix test`).

Format code:

```sh
bin/fmt
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter WX library issues during Erlang installation:

```sh
# Disable WX during installation
export KERL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--without-wx"
```

To persist this setting, add it to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`).

## Examples

There's an example console project in `examples/feature_flag_demo` that shows how to use the client. Follow the instructions in [the README](examples/feature_flag_demo/README.md) to run it.
